# Creating an e-book using AI

## 📒 Description
This is a project where AI tools were used to create an e-book about HTML tags.

## 🤖 Used tools
- **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)** for creating title and content, with its respective structure;
- **[Craiyon](craiyon.com)** for creating the e-book's cover art;
- **Microsoft Office PowerPoint** for editing the layout and pages.

## 🧐 Creation process
First, **ChatGPT** was used to generate a title for the e-book with a creative aspect and pleasant theme. Later, **Craiyon** was used to create the e-book's cover art, followed by ChatGPT, which generated the e-book's content. Then, PowerPoint was used to create the pages and the cover, using a wanted style and layout.

## 🚀 Results
The e-book showed a rich and easy to understand content, showing how generative AIs can be used to generate content in a creative and natural manner, being useful for knowledge sharing.
