# Creating podcasts using AI

## 📒 Description
This project involved the creation of a short podcast about AI, having its content generated by ChatGPT.

## 🤖 Used tools
- **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)** for creating podcast name and content;
- **[ElevenLabs](https://www.elevenlabs.io)** for voice synthesis (text-to-speech);
- **[CapCut Web](https://www.capcut.com/my-edit?start_tab=video)** for podast editing.

## 🧐 Creation process
First, **ChatGPT** was used to create the podcast's name and content. Then, the generated content was converted to a raw audio using **ElevenLabs**. Finally, the raw audio file was processed and edited using **CapCut Web**.

## 🚀 Results
The generative AI tools reduced the time required to build a podcast's script, and the text-to-speech conversion generated an audio file which sounded so natural some people may not notice it was AI generated.
